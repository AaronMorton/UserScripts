# What is this?
Ever been in a Google Meet meeting and had someone accidentally raise their hand because the "Raise Hand" button looks like a clap emojii? I have (at two different companies), so I made this userscript.
FixGoogleMeet will change the icon for the "Raise Hand" button to be less confusing. Fair warning, it does this with a mutation observer and some polling fallbacks, so it is running a small amount of
code the whole time your Meet window is open - but realistically it's fine.
